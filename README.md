This project sought to examine the composition and diversity of coral-associated microbiomes. Coral tissue and surrounding water, and sediment samples were collected from coral species Acropora cervicornis, Orbicella faveolata, and Siderastrea siderea at seven reef sites within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) between November 2016 and February 2018. These samples were  processed in the laboratory for characterization of their microbial assemblages using amplicon 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, and data was examined in the context of corresponding environmental conditions derived from satellite remote sensing observations. The microbiomes were evaluated at the alpha and beta diversity levels, and the ANCOM package was used to determine which species were driving observed differences. Core microbiomes were also calculated to determine which bacteria species are consistently found in the coral microbiome, the coral sediment and the surrounding water column.
